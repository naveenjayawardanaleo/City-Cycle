Android is the platform of choice for CityCycle Rentals due
to its leading global market share of 70%, cost effectiveness and inherent
flexibility as an open source platform. Its broad market presence in urban areas
with heterogeneous device environments is critical, with the caveat that it is
vulnerable to device fragmentation issues and modestly increased security risks
compared to iOS. Android Studio's cross-platform compatibility and sophisticated
debugging tools further support this choice, while Xcode's limitation to the macOS
platform limits market visibility. The use of Kotlin, complemented by proven
alternatives such as Java, combined with SQLite, Firebase Authentication, Retrofit
and secure payment processing, ensures excellent scalability, security and
performance.
